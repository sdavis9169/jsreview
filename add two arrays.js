// I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

// P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.\


function sum (arr1, arr2){
    let num = 0;
    for (let i=0;i<arr1.length; i++){
        for (let k=0;k<arr2.length; k++){
            return num += arr1[i]
        }
    } return newArr
}

console.log(sum([1,2,3], [4,5,6]))
